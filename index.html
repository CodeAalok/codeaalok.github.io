<p>This is only a dummy content to fill the website.  The 
Department of Sociology was established by the University 
of Delhi in 1959 as a constituent of the Delhi School of 
Economics with the eminent sociologist Professor M.N. 
Srinivas as Head of the Department.</p>
<p>The department is abstraction personified.</p>
