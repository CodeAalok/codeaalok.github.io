    <h1 align="center"> The Development in Chatra</h1>
    Chatra, the gateway of Jharkhand particularly of Chotanagpur, has a glorious past having an eminent historical heritage. The land has been the silent spectator of the vicissitudes of the historical unfolding of human drama.
    One of the most striking features of 1942â€“ Quit India Movement, was the escape of Shri Jay Prakash Narayan along with six other from The Hazaribagh Central Jail on 9th November 1942 (the night of Diwali). Jai Prakash Narayan came to Tatra( a village of Chatra) and then proceeded towards Sherghati en route to Varanasi . Chotanagpur Kesri, Babu Ram Narayan Singh and Babu Shaligram Singh gave stiff resistance to the British. Their sacrifice bore fruit and India got freedom from the British yoke on the 15th of August 1947 A.D. Thus, Chatra played a short but memorable cameo on the historical canvas of the freedom movement.
